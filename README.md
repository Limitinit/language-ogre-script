# Ogre Scripts support in Atom

Syntax highlighting for Ogre Scripts.

Based on the [Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/TheSHEEEP/ST-OgreScripts). Extended for particle scripts.

## TODO
* refactor the plugin to work on tokens. Currently it tries to verify property values, which causes duplication and does not cope with variables
* overlay scripts
* font definition scripts
* split more of ogre-common into script specific files to reduce false positives
